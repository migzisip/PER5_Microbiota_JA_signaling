## ðŸ§ª Scripts for RNA-seq Analysis

This section contains scripts for:

- RNA-seq preprocessing and quality control
- Read alignment and quantification
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Functional enrichment and visualization

### 1.1 Experimental Design and Raw Data

Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and Ws4, as well as mutant lines including **per5**, were used in transcriptomic experiments.  
Plants were germinated with synthetic bacterial community **At-16SC1** on half-strength MS medium for 14 days. Roots and shoots were harvested separately and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).

RNA-seq libraries were prepared by Novogene-Europe and sequenced on an Illumina platform (paired-end 150 bp), with an average depth of ~3 Gb per sample. Each biological condition had 3 replicates.  

Raw reads will be deposited in GEO under accession **[GSEXXXXX]** (to be updated upon release).

### 1.2 Read Pre-processing and Alignment

Quality Checking and Trimming: [pre_processing_Script.sh](Scripts/pre_processing_Script.sh)
Alignment: [align_kallisto_script.sh](Scripts/align_kallisto_script.sh)

Raw RNA-seq reads were processed using **fastp** (v0.23.2) with default parameters for paired-end reads. Adapter sequences and low-quality bases were trimmed.  

High-quality reads were pseudo-aligned to the *Arabidopsis thaliana* TAIR10.58 transcriptome using **kallisto** (Bray et al., 2016). On average, ~11.6 million paired-end reads were obtained per sample.

Transcript-level quantifications were imported using **tximport** (Soneson et al., 2016) into R for downstream analysis.

### 1.3 Normalization and Clustering

Roots: [Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R](Scripts/Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R)  
Shoots: [Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R](Scripts/Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R)

Low-abundance transcripts absent in at least two replicates were removed.  
Counts were log2-transformed and batch effects were corrected using surrogate variable analysis (SVA) and the `removeBatchEffect()` function in the **limma** package (Ritchie et al., 2015).

Normalized counts were scaled and z-transformed by transcript.  
Z-scores were used for **k-means clustering** (k = 8), with cluster number determined by SSE and AIC.

### Output:

### 1.4 Differential Expression and GO Enrichment

Differential expression was analyzed using **DESeq2** (Love et al., 2014). Key comparisons included:

1. per5 mock vs WT mock  
2. SynCom-treated WT vs WT mock  
3. SynCom-treated per5 vs SynCom-treated WT  
4. SynCom-treated per5 vs per5 mock  

Transcripts with adjusted p-value â‰¤ 0.05 and |log2FC| â‰¥ log2(1.5) were considered significant.

Roots: [Rscript_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R](Scripts/Rscript_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R)  
Shoots: [script_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R](Scripts/Rscript_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R)

**GO enrichment** was performed using **GOseq** (Young et al., 2010), accounting for transcript length bias.  
Significant Biological Process terms (adj. p < 0.05) were visualized with **clusterProfiler** (Yu et al., 2012).

Roots: [Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R](Scripts/Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R)  
Shoots: [Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R](Scripts/Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R)

## ðŸŒ¿ Marker Gene Analysis for JA and SA Pathways

This script generates a heatmap of selected marker genes involved in **jasmonic acid (JA)** and **salicylic acid (SA)** signaling pathways based on RNA-seq data from Arabidopsis roots and shoots.  

Z-score normalized logâ‚‚ fold-change values for different genotypes and SynCom treatments are visualized to highlight hormone-responsive expression patterns. Marker genes were grouped by functional annotation, and plotted using the `ComplexHeatmap` package.

JA: 

 Root SA: [Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Root.R](Scripts/Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Root.R)  
Shoot SA: [Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Shoot.R](Scripts/Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Shoot.R)

ðŸ“Š Output: [SA marker PER5 Root.pdf](<Data/SA marker PER5 Root.pdf>);   [SA marker PER5 Shoot.pdf](<Data/SA marker PER5 Shoot.pdf>)

*More details and usage instructions can be found in each script folder.*
