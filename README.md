## 🧬 Scripts for RNA-seq Analysis

This section contains scripts for:

- RNA-seq preprocessing and quality control
- Read alignment and quantification
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Functional enrichment and visualization

### 1.1 Experimental Design and Raw Data

Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and Ws4, as well as mutant lines including **per5**, were used in transcriptomic experiments.
Plants were germinated with synthetic bacterial community **At-16SC1** on half-strength MS medium for 14 days. Roots and shoots were harvested separately and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).

RNA-seq libraries were prepared by Novogene-Europe and sequenced on an Illumina platform (paired-end 150 bp), with an average depth of ~3 Gb per sample. Each biological condition had 3 replicates.

Raw reads will be deposited in GEO under accession **PRJNA1314934** (to be updated upon release).

---

### 1.2 Read Pre-processing and Alignment

Quality Checking and Trimming: [pre_processing_Script.sh](Scripts/pre_processing_Script.sh)
Alignment: [align_kallisto_script.sh](Scripts/align_kallisto_script.sh)

Raw RNA-seq reads were processed using **fastp** (v0.23.2) with default parameters for paired-end reads. Adapter sequences and low-quality bases were trimmed.

High-quality reads were pseudo-aligned to the *Arabidopsis thaliana* TAIR10.58 transcriptome using **kallisto** (Bray et al., 2016). On average, ~11.6 million paired-end reads were obtained per sample.

Transcript-level quantifications were imported using **tximport** (Soneson et al., 2016) into R for downstream analysis.

### 1.3 Normalization and Clustering

Roots: [Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R](Scripts/Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R)
Shoots: [Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R](Scripts/Rscript_Kmeans_Clustering_Heatmap_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R)

Low-abundance transcripts absent in at least two replicates were removed.
Counts were log2-transformed and batch effects were corrected using surrogate variable analysis (SVA) and the `removeBatchEffect()` function in the **limma** package (Ritchie et al., 2015).

Normalized counts were scaled and z-transformed by transcript.
Z-scores were used for **k-means clustering** (k = 8), with cluster number determined by SSE and AIC.

### Output:

---

### 1.4 Differential Expression and GO Enrichment

Differential expression was analyzed using **DESeq2** (Love et al., 2014). Key comparisons included:

1. per5 mock vs WT mock
2. SynCom-treated WT vs WT mock
3. SynCom-treated per5 vs SynCom-treated WT
4. SynCom-treated per5 vs per5 mock

Transcripts with adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and |log2FC| ≥ log2(1.5) were considered significant.

Roots: [Rscript_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R](Scripts/Rscript_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R)
Shoots: [script_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R](Scripts/Rscript_DEG_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R)

**GO enrichment** was performed using **GOseq** (Young et al., 2010), accounting for transcript length bias.
Significant Biological Process terms (adj. p < 0.05) were visualized with **clusterProfiler** (Yu et al., 2012).

Roots: [Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R](Scripts/Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Roots.R)
Shoots: [Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R](Scripts/Rscript_GO_analysis_PER5_SynCom16_Shoots.R)

## 🌿 Marker Gene Analysis for JA and SA Pathways

This script generates a heatmap of selected marker genes involved in **jasmonic acid (JA)** and **salicylic acid (SA)** signaling pathways based on RNA-seq data from Arabidopsis roots and shoots.

Z-score normalized log₂ fold-change values for different genotypes and SynCom treatments are visualized to highlight hormone-responsive expression patterns. Marker genes were grouped by functional annotation, and plotted using the `ComplexHeatmap` package.

JA:

 Root SA: [Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Root.R](Scripts/Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Root.R)
Shoot SA: [Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Shoot.R](Scripts/Rscript_SA_Marker_Genes_Shoot.R)

📊 Output: [SA marker PER5 Root.pdf](Data/SA marker PER5 Root.pdf);   [SA marker PER5 Shoot.pdf](Data/SA marker PER5 Shoot.pdf)

## 🧫 Scripts for microbiome Analysis

# batch 1 of microbial profiling of per5 vs. WS4 (genotype effect)

The ASV table from batch 1 was originally generated based on relative abundance but not spike normalized absolute abundance so here uses a different asv table as the input abundance table [asv_table_ws4per5_not_normalized.txt](Data/asv_table_ws4per5_not_normalized.txt), a metadata file [ws4per5_design_BC.txt](Data/ws4per5_design_BC.txt), and a taxonomy file [taxonomy_all.txt](Data/taxonomy_all.txt), using the R script [anosim_adonis2_betadisper_Fig 1D.R](Scripts/anosim_adonis2_betadisper_Fig 1D.R)

# batch 2 of microbial profiling of per5 vs. WS4 under DCB and MeJA treatment

### 2.1 Read Pre-processing and generating ASV table using Rbec [microbiome-qiime2_processing.sh](Scripts/microbiome-qiime2_processing.sh)

The raw reads were first demultiplexed using Cutadapt in QIIME2-2024.10-amplicon (Bolyen et al., 2019), followed by primer removal, merging of the paired-end reads with FLASH2 (Magoč et al., 2011), filtering of low-quality sequences using USEARCH (Robert et al., 2010), and generation of the ASV table with Rbec (Zhang et al., 2021).

### 2.2 Differential abundance analysis [LFC_LFC_scatterplot.R](Scripts/LFC_LFC_scatterplot.R)

### 2.3 Bubble plot [rbec.R](Scripts/rbec.R)

### 2.4 Statistical analyses for betadiversity (ANOSIM, Adonis2, PERMDISP) [anosim_adonis2_betadisper.R](Scripts/anosim_adonis2_betadisper.R)

# 🦠JA–Bacteria Alignment Pipeline

This repository provides a workflow to:

- Fetch **Arabidopsis** jasmonic-acid (JA) biosynthesis/signaling proteins from **UniProt**
- Download **16 bacterial proteomes** from **NCBI** (`.faa`)
- Build a **DIAMOND** protein database
- Run **DIAMOND** `blastp`
- **Summarize** results in **R**
- **Visualize** as a heatmap and export for figure editing

---

## Requirements

- **Conda/Mamba** (recommended)
- **Python 3.11** + `requests` (for UniProt fetch)
- **NCBI datasets** CLI (the download script can auto-fetch the binary if missing)
- **DIAMOND v2.1.11** (pin this version for reproducibility)
- **R** (for summarization & visualization scripts)

---

## 1) Retrieve Plant JA-biosynthesis genes from UniProt

**Script:** [fetch_ja_from_uniprot.py](Scripts/fetch_ja_from_uniprot.py)
Fetches curated TAIR10 JA biosynthesis/signaling proteins and writes a FASTA plus a mapping table.

```bash
# (recommended) new env
mamba create -n ja-uniprot python=3.11 requests -c conda-forge
mamba activate ja-uniprot

python fetch_ja_from_uniprot.py
```

**Outputs**

```
out/ja_uniprot.faa
out/ja_uniprot_map.tsv
```

---

## 2) Retrieve 16 bacterial proteomes from NCBI

**Script:** [get_bacteria_proteins.sh](Scripts/get_bacteria_proteins.sh)
(Downloads protein FASTAs.)

Create `assemblies.txt` with one GenBank/RefSeq assembly accession per line (16 total), e.g.:

```
GCF_000005845.2
GCF_000006765.1
...
```

**Run**

```bash
# Example working directory 
cd /RAID1/working/R324/lailoi/LaiLoi/Per5  (adjust if needed)
bash get_bacteria_proteins.sh assemblies.txt
```

**Outputs (typical)**

```
bacteria_genomes/ncbi_dataset/data/<ACCESSION>/protein.faa[.gz]   # per assembly
```

---

## 3) Build the DIAMOND database

Convert the combined `.faa` into a DIAMOND DB:

```bash
diamond makedb --in data/ref_bacteria_proteins.faa -d data/bac_db
# produces: data/bac_db.dmnd
```

---

## 4) Run DIAMOND (v2.1.11)

More info: https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond (Buchfink et al., 2021).

```bash
diamond blastp \
  --ultra-sensitive \
  --id 35 \
  -q out/ja_uniprot.faa \
  -d data/bac_db \
  -o out/results_bact16.tsv \
  -f 6 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore
```

- `--ultra-sensitive` improves recovery of distant homologs
- `--id 35` keeps alignments with ≥35% identity
- Add `--header` to include column names in the TSV

---

## 5) Summarize results (R)

**Script:** [Sumarize_results_from_DIAMOND.R](Scripts/Sumarize_results_from_DIAMOND.R)Organizes DIAMOND output into tidy long format and matrices (e.g., counts, max/mean % identity, presence/absence).

- **Input:** `out/results_bact16.tsv`
- **Outputs:** CSVs for downstream plotting.

---

## 6) Visualize heatmap (R)

**Script:** [Visualize_bacterial_genome_with_plant_JA.R](Scripts/Visualize_bacterial_genome_with_plant_JA.R)
Generates a single-panel heatmap (ordered by pathway and sample index). Export to **SVG/PNG** for figures.

---

## 7) Final figure editing

Open the exported **SVG** in **Inkscape** (or Illustrator) to adjust fonts, labels, and layout for publication.

---

## Reproducibility & tips

- Record software versions (Python, `requests`, **DIAMOND 2.1.11**, R packages).
- If you change DIAMOND filters (`--evalue`, `--id`, `--query-cover`, `--subject-cover`), re-run Step 5 to regenerate matrices.
- Keep `assemblies.txt` under version control to document the exact proteome set.
